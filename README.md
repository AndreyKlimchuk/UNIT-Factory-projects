LIBFT

The goal of this project is to create own library composed of recoded functions from 
basic C libraries and extend it by your own useful functions in future.

FILLIT

The goal of this project is to arrange the Tetriminos (4-blocks geometric figure from tetris) themselves to make the
smallest possible square, but in some cases, this square may have holes when some given
pieces wonâ€™t fit perfectly with others. Among the different solutions
possible to make the smallest square, only the solution where Tetriminos is placed on
their most upper-left position, is acceptable.
